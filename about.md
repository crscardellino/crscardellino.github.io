It's been quite a while since my days learning programming languages by myself
with the sole intention to develop a videogame, of course I didn't event know
what did the word "develop" mean back in those days.

The years went on, I was just a teenager in that time and I really thought at
some point it would be easy to program my first game, like if it was a simple
thing to do. I was wrong. It's still hard nowadays, and there are lots of
frameworks to facilitate the process of creating videogames. Back then was
plainly impossible without a big team. Not at least the kind of games I wanted
to create.

I went to college and got my degree in Computer Sciences in 2013. As I finished
and wasn't really aware of what to do with my degree I started a PhD. I
finished my PhD in the area of Machine Learning (with focus on semisupervised
learning and deep learning) and Natural Language Processing (working on Spanish
verb sense disambiguation and legal information extraction) in 2018.

I enjoy coding and learning programming languages in general, and I try new
tools when I get bored on the ones I am working with. The language I use the
most is Python, but I also code in C/C++, Scala (I specially like the Spark
framework), Ruby, BASH (and it suite of tools for text processing like AWK or
SED), and I can proudly say I have Perl readability.

I am an adjunct professor at the [_Facultad de Matemática, Astronomía, Física, y
Computación_](http://www.famaf.unc.edu.ar/) in the _Universidad Nacional de
Córdoba_, where I have been in different courses through the years:

- Computer Networks and Distributed Systems
- Databases
- Programming Paradigms
- Software Engineering

I've also have taught courses in areas more related to my PhD., I was part of
the specialization courses on data science and machine learning that is taught
at the [_Diplomatura en Ciencia de Datos, Aprendizaje Automático y sus
Aplicaciones_](https://diplodatos.famaf.unc.edu.ar/) (or _DiploDatos_ for
short), there I was part of the following courses:

- [Supervised Machine Learning](https://sites.google.com/unc.edu.ar/diplodatos-supervisado)
- [Introduction to Deep Learning](https://github.com/DiploDatos/AprendizajeProfundo).
- [Introduction to Receommender Systems](https://github.com/DiploDatos/SistemasDeRecomendacion/)

Right now I am a full time researcher at [Mercado
Libre](https://www.mercadolibre.com/), the leader platform in e-Commerce in
Latin America. I am currently working on representation learning for products in
the e-Commerce platform with special focus on multimodal learning and transfer
learning scenarios.

Other areas of work, interest and research are:

- Argumentation mining (as part of the [MIREL project](http://www.mirelproject.eu/)).
- Recommender Systems (designed one to recommend Magic The Gathering Cards for
  [TappedOut.net](http://tappedout.net/)).
- Unsupervised Word Representations (creator and maintainer of the
  [SBWCE]({{ "/SBWCE" | absolute_url }})).
