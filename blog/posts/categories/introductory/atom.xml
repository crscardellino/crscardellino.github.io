    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As every programmer trying to learn a new language, I think is suitable for me
to start this professional blog with a Hello World. So, in this first blog post
I say Hello World!</p>

<p>This is the first blog I&rsquo;ve created that has relation with what I do for a
living. The only other surviving blog is a personal one (and is in Spanish
also).</p>

<p>The aim of this place is to write about Computer Sciences problems and
solutions I came across to overcome them, most of them of course are
programming ones.</p>

<p>As I said in my about page, I was for a long time a Python programmer, but now
I turn myself into the world of Scala and it has so interesting I&rsquo;ve
practically abandoned my old time coding Python skills (of course, with Python,
is never that hard to return).</p>

<p>I hope my posts will help you somehow.</p>
