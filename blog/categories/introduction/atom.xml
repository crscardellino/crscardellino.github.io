    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As every programmer trying to learn a new language, I think is suitable for me
to start this professional blog with a Hello World. So, in this first blog post
I say Hello World!</p>

<p>This is the first blog I’ve created that has relation with what I do for a
living. The only other surviving blog is a personal one (and is in Spanish
also).</p>

<p>The aim of this place is to write about Computer Sciences problems and solutions
I came across to overcome them, most of them of course are programming ones.</p>

<p>As I said in my about page, I was for a long time a Python programmer, but now I
turn myself into the world of Scala and it has so interesting I’ve practically
abandoned my old time coding Python skills (of course, with Python, is never
that hard to return).</p>

<p>I hope my posts will help you somehow.</p>
