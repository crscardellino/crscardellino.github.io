                <p>When I started the university I thought of myself as a
                programmer. Like most of all, I've started with the idea of
                programming videogames. I'd also flirted with hacking and
                security. I like logic, and computability theory, and I still
                enjoy the pleasure of coding. For the last 4 years I've been a
                Python developer although I used C or C++ from time to time.
                Now, however, I've been diving in the sea of Scala, just for a
                change, and I've been abandoning other tools since then
                (although I still use JavaScript for front end development).
                I'm also a regular user of text processing languages, mainly
                the ones in BASH: AWK and SED being my top choice.</p>

                <p>However, nowadays I'm a kind of hybrid between a Computer
                Scientist and a Linguistic. I'm actually a PhD. Student at
                FaMAF in CÃ³rdoba, Argentina, in the area of Information
                Extraction, in the huge field of Natural Language
                Processing.</p>

                <p>If you've read my Twitter bio, and of course, you know
                Spanish, you'll find out I'm also a geek, a gamer and a rager,
                and I have serious OCD problems. Just another person trying to
                leave his mark in the world.</p> </article>
