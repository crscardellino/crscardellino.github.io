    h2 About me

    p.justify
      | It's been quite a while since my days learning programming languages by myself 
      | with the sole intention to develop a videogame, of course I didn't event
      | know what did the word "develop" mean back in those days.
      
    p.justify
      | The years went on, I was just a teenager in that time and I really thought 
      | at some point it would be easy to program my first game, a natural thing. I was wrong. 
      | It's still hard nowadays, and there are lots of frameworks to facilitate the 
      | process of creating videogames. Back then was plainly impossible without a
      | big team. Not at least the kind of games I wanted to create.

    p.justify
      | Years later I started the university thinking I was going to become a programmer. Besides videogames 
      | I show interest in hacking and security, but I'm a long way to be an expert in that. 
      | I like logic, computability theory,   and enjoy coding for hobby. For the last 4 years I've been a
      | Python developer although I also programmed in C or C++ from time to time. Now, however,
      | I've been diving in the seas of Scala and JavaScript, just for a change, and I've been
      | abandoning other tools since then. I'm also a regular user of scripting
      | languages like SH, AWK and SED. I get bored fairly easy, so I try to learn new things 
      | and experiment different technologies every time I can.

    p.justify
      | I have a masters in Computer Sciences which I obtained in 2013.
      | And in the present time I'm a kind of hybrid between a Computer Scientist and a
      | Linguist. I'm a Natural Language Proccessing PhD. Student at FaMAF in CÃ³rdoba, Argentina.
      | But if you want to know more about me, this is my personal web: You can check my 
      | <a href="/contact">contact information</a> as well as <a href="/social">social networking</a>. 
      | I run two blogs: a <a href="/blog">technical one</a> and a 
      | <a href="http://waitingragnarok.crscardellino.me" target="_blank">personal one</a>
      | (in spanish). But, I'm the first to warn, I'm very lazy and post only when I feel
      | like it. However, you are welcome to check on them. Hope you enjoy!
