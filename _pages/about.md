It's been quite a while since my days learning programming languages by myself with the sole intention of developing a videogame. Of course, I didn't even know what the word "develop" meant back in those days.

The years went on. I was just a teenager at that time, and I really thought, at some point, it would be easy to program my first videogame, as if it was a simple thing to do. I was wrong. It's still hard nowadays, and there are lots of frameworks to facilitate the process of creating videogames. Back then was plainly impossible without a big team. Not at least the kind of games I wanted to create.

I went to college and got my degree in Computer Science in 2013. As I finished and wasn't really aware of what to do with my degree, I started a PhD. I finished my PhD in the area of Machine Learning (with a focus on semisupervised learning and deep learning) and Natural Language Processing (working on Spanish verb sense disambiguation and legal information extraction) in 2018.

I enjoy coding and learning programming languages in general, and I try new tools when I get bored with the ones I am working with. The language I use the most is Python, but I also code in C/C++, Scala (I especially like the Spark framework), JavaScript, Ruby, BASH (and its suite of tools for text processing like AWK or SED), and I can proudly say I have Perl readability. The last language I'm learning is Rust.

I was an adjunct professor at the [_Facultad de Matemática, Astronomía, Física, y Computación_](http://www.famaf.unc.edu.ar/) in the _Universidad Nacional de Córdoba_ for almost ten years, where I was part of different courses:

- Computer Networks and Distributed Systems
- Databases
- Programming Paradigms
- Software Engineering

I've also taught courses in areas more related to my PhD., I was part of the specialization courses on data science and machine learning that is taught at the [_Diplomatura en Ciencia de Datos, Aprendizaje Automático y sus Aplicaciones_](https://diplodatos.famaf.unc.edu.ar/) (or _DiploDatos_ for short), there I was part of the following courses:

- [Supervised Machine Learning](https://sites.google.com/unc.edu.ar/diplodatos-supervisado)
- [Introduction to Deep Learning](https://github.com/DiploDatos/AprendizajeProfundo).
- [Introduction to Recommender Systems](https://github.com/DiploDatos/SistemasDeRecomendacion/)

My last job in Argentina was as a full-time researcher at [Mercado Libre](https://www.mercadolibre.com/), the leading platform in e-Commerce in Latin America. I worked on representation learning for products in the e-Commerce platform with a special focus on multimodal learning and transfer learning scenarios. Currently, I'm doing a postdoc at "Université Côte d'Azur" in France, within the Wimmics Team, on Argumentation Mining.

Other areas of work, interest and research are:

- Argumentation mining (as part of the [MIREL project](http://www.mirelproject.eu/)).
- Recommender Systems (designed one to recommend Magic The Gathering Cards for [TappedOut.net](http://tappedout.net/)).
- Unsupervised Word Representations (creator and maintainer of the [SBWCE]({{ "/SBWCE" | absolute_url }})).

I also enjoy the work as a machine learning engineer. I like the whole MLOps process, particularly the setup of APIs to run machine learning models with the corresponding configurations and dockerization of the process. I work as a TopTal freelancer, mostly doing this kind of project.

I'm active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/crscardellino) (although I tweet mostly in Spanish), and now I'm slowly moving to [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@crscardellino), but for work-related stuff, probably the best way to contact me is through my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/crscardellino/).
